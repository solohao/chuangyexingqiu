# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modifying the project manager component and operation logs to change from dark theme (black background) to light theme (white background) to improve visual consistency and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the project manager sidebar to have a light background instead of dark, so that it matches the overall light theme of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project manager sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a white or light gray background instead of the current dark gray/black background
2. WHEN the project manager sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL use dark text colors for proper contrast against the light background
3. WHEN hovering over project items THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate light-themed hover states
4. WHEN a project is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight it with appropriate light-themed selection colors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the operation logs terminal to have a light background instead of dark, so that it provides better readability and consistency with the light theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the operation logs terminal is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a white or light gray background instead of the current dark background
2. WHEN the operation logs terminal is displayed THEN the system SHALL use dark text colors for log entries to ensure readability
3. WHEN the terminal header is displayed THEN the system SHALL use light-themed colors for the terminal icon and title
4. WHEN the close button is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate light-themed styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interactive elements in both components to maintain proper accessibility standards, so that the interface remains usable after the theme change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any interactive element is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast ratios according to WCAG guidelines
2. WHEN buttons and links are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for hover and focus states
3. WHEN status indicators are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain clearly visible against the light background
